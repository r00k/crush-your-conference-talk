Intro

Most important point: don't be boring.
  Dirty secret of conferences - people do them because they're free vacation
  "Who is being paid right now?" show of hands
  Even bad conferences are more fun than work

How to not be boring
  Delivery is king. Not content.
    Story about Nick Q's TDD talk
  Do you need to be funny?
    Nope. There are other options. Don't fake a personality. Instead, do these things:
  Love your topic
    Never give a talk on something you're not obsessed with
  Tell stories
    MagicFS story
  Skip your introduction
    Don't introduce yourself for long
    Don't introduce your topic for long
  Skip the slides
    Live code a refactoring - NullObject maybe?
  Realize that every 10 minutes, you need to wake people up
    Clap when hands together
    Joke - best part of this is it scares the crap out of people who aren't paying attention
  Practice a ton
    Give it to a practice audience if at all possible
    Simulate the talk conditions as best as possible
      Resolution
      Room
      Mic


On content
  A conference talk is a poor medium for teaching someone
    The average attendee will be able to retain one or two specific ideas
    The rest is just groundwork that will let them learn more later on their own
    Hit them with the most important thing up front, and repeat it
    Go fast
      Slow students will only absorb a little, whether you go fast or slow
      Faster students will absorb more if you go faster
    Have synchronization points where people who tuned out can get back in
  
Dealing with nerves
  Have a friend sit in the front and nod and laugh a lot


How to write a good proposal
  The most important idea - realize who is reading it: some poor bastard who has to read 100 other proposals
  Be brief
  Be lighthearted
  Show social proof
  Promise to help promote the conf


Handling questions
  How to prompt
  Repeat it back
  Freely admit ignorance
